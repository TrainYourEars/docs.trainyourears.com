# Live Feedback

Have you ever heard a **feedback at a concert**? Annoying, right? Way worse when you are the sound engineer and everybody looks at you!

In this video Alex Mars, from [XSSR Academy](http://xssracademy.com/), shows you how to train your ears to catch those feedbacks as quickly as possible. The **Live Feedback Exercise** emulates the sound of a feedback which is "about to happen".
