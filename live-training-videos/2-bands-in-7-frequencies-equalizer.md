# 2 Bands in a 7 Frequencies Equalizer

In this video Alex Mars, from [XSSR Academy](http://xssracademy.com/), takes a quick look at a training exercise called "**Find 2 bands in a 7 frequencies equalizer**".

The main goal of this exercise is to find 2 frequencies that are changed in the audio source and correct them. As Alex suggests, listen carefully and don't be afraid to play with the bands. You'll have to make a decision on how the audio sounds and how to make it better.

During the exercise, Alex uses a Coins' album called "Daft Science", available [here](https://coinsmakeyoudance.bandcamp.com/album/daft-science).
