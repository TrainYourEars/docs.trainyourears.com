## Andrei Georgescuâ€™s introduction

> **This package is intended for intermediate and advanced users.**
>
> This package continues off from my last one, [Slow Sound Modulations](slow-sound-modulations.md). It is under the same vein of training your ears using non-static modulations in order to train them more for complex real world application than a purely static modulation could do.
>
> The last package used heavy and obvious modulations. This one, however, does not go that route, but instead focuses on very subtle modulations over long periods of time. Morphing ambient pads and strangely repeating plucks are the sounds I've chosen for this purpose.
>
> In some ways this may be much easier or much more difficult depending on many factors, including how fast the user is at identifying the equalization. The reason for this is because if the user cannot identify in a short period of time what equalization is being used, the sound will have already changed, but so subtly that in many ways it could throw off the user's estimation and confuse them all together.
>
> In this sense, I consider this a "time attack mode". It becomes very easy when you identify the equalization almost immediately but very difficult when you can't, thus it forces the user to make quick split second decisions and learn to trust their gut because many a time, second guessing yourself when it comes to ear training, is not a good thing.
>
> Another important difference to the last package is that the equalizations are more complex and difficult because the modulations are no longer as drastic in comparison. The difficulty is no direct order, you choose your own based off of the combination of sound and equalization exercise.

Please note that in order to properly use this package you have to enable the "Loop Song" feature in the Audio Player screen:
