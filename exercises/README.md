# EXERCISE PACKAGES

These sets of exercises have been created by different users of TrainYourEars, all qualified sound professionals.

Each package covers different topics, but they are all designed to improve your frequency recognition and level up your aural skills. You can introduce changes to make the exercises easier or harder, so they're useful for all levels too: from beginners to professionals.

Train constantly to get better results, and have fun while practicing!
