# Audio Player

In the Audio Player you can load and play audio files.

The type of files supported by TrainYourEars are `wav`, `aif`, `mp3`, `ogg` and `m4a`.

If you haven't added any files yet, you will see this screen:

![](../.gitbook/assets/drag-and-drop.png)

You can drag and drop files, folders or click on the `Open File` or `Open Folder` buttons.

If you choose `Open Folder` or drag a folder it will search in the subfolders as well.

Once you have added some files, you will see the Audio Player:

{% hint style="info" %}
You can still drag and drop files or folders in this screen and they will be added to the playlist.
{% endhint %}

The Audio Player has different sections. Let's see what they do:

## Playlist Buttons

### Add File

Add a file to the playlist.

### Add Folder

Add a folder to the playlist. It will search in the subfolders as well.

### Delete Selected

Remove the selected audio file from the playlist.

### Delete All

Clear the playlist and go back to the Drag and Drop screen.

## Playlist

Use it to select the song you want to play.

## Random Player option

![](../.gitbook/assets/random-player.png)

TrainYourEars can jump to a random song each time you start a new quiz. This is interesting because each quiz will be totally different from the previous one.

It is recommended when you want to make the current exercise more challenging.

## Waveform

Click to jump to different parts of the song or create loops \(explained in the **audio loop** section.\)

## Audio Player Controls

![](../.gitbook/assets/audio-player-controls.png)

You can go the previous song, the next song, stop, pause and play.

There are two additional buttons. The first one let's you loop over a defined section \(Audio Loop\) and the second one over the whole song \(Song Loop\).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also control Play/Pause using the spacebar.
{% endhint %}

### Audio Loop

If you click and drag on the waveform you will create a loop, marked in red \(as seen in the waveform image\). If you select the button labeled as `Loop`, the audio will be looped over that section.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you have activated the Random Player option, the loop will be lost once you start a new quiz and TrainYourEars jumps to another song and time.
{% endhint %}

### Song Loop

If you click on the button labeled as `Song` the whole song will be played again once it has finished.

## Note: Audio may be muted

Sometimes you can see an advice like this:

This happens when your current exercise has the option `Mute and play it only for X seconds`. Don't worry if you don't hear anything, the audio will start when you start the quiz.
